        <!-- The weird comment tags after each list item here is to address
        an annoying inline-block behaviour that adds extra space to the right
        of list items, which causes a gap in between our horizontal buttons.
                
        This solution only breaks in IE6 or 7, but is one of the "cleaner"
        solutions. I think this compromise is more than acceptable.

                The project is to redesign the COMP 1950 website. However, we are not redesigning
                without reasons. While giving COMP 1950 a new look can create a fresh new experience
                for its visitors, that is not a good enough reason. Instead, the primary goal here
                is to fulfill the needs to improve the website's ease of use, presentation of content, 
                and common functionalities. In addition to restyling the website with a great looking new theme,
                our team has focused on transforming the website into something that is intuitively simple
                and easy to use.

                <header>
                	<h1>Design Rationale</h1>
            	</header>
            	
            	<h2>Clarity and Simplicity</h2>
            	                	
                <p>
                We believe the most important content in the COMP 1950 website is text. Specifically, the lecture notes.
                Therefore, we've considered many choices involving typography, and you
                will see that our choices reflect the idea of making texts easy and pleasant to read. We achieved that
                by using a beautiful font, larger font sizes, and a neutral and soothing colour palette. We are also aware that
                students enjoy minimizing the time they need to spend on reviewing online content, so providing a faster
                searching and browsing experience was paramount. We were able to achieve half of this goal earlier by 
                taking care of the font, because reading is now easy and fast. We then found out that scrolling and navigating
                through the enormous amount of content wasn't as fast and as easy as it could be, so we added features such as, a static
                navigation menu that stays on top of your screen, an automatic hiding search bar attached
                underneath the navigation menu, and automatic scrolling links that take you to any points of
                interest on the current page. As a result, we've successfully reduced the amount of time spent scrolling, searching,
                and squinting eyes when using the new COMP 1950 website. That's clarity and simplicity.
